15. [ ] Implement standard exercise component interface
16. [ ] Add flashcard completion tracking
17. [ ] Create CSS styling for flashcard component
18. [ ] Add accessibility features for flashcards

20. [ ] Replace quiz placeholder text with QuizExercise component
21. [ ] Import FlashcardExercise component in `LessonDetail.jsx`
22. [ ] Replace flashcard placeholder text with FlashcardExercise component
23. [ ] Ensure proper props passing to exercise components
24. [ ] Test modal integration and styling
25. [ ] Verify exercise completion callbacks work correctly
26. [ ] Test exercise switching and state management

### 2.2 Progress System Integration
27. [ ] Verify quiz completion triggers progress updates
28. [ ] Test scoring thresholds and completion criteria
29. [ ] Ensure quiz results are properly tracked
30. [ ] Validate progress persistence across sessions
31. [ ] Test progress reporting for different quiz scores

### 2.3 Testing and Validation
32. [ ] Test all existing quiz data renders correctly
33. [ ] Verify answer submission and validation works
34. [ ] Test results display and scoring accuracy
35. [ ] Validate retry functionality works properly
36. [ ] Test cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
37. [ ] Test mobile responsiveness and touch interactions
38. [ ] Validate accessibility with screen readers
39. [ ] Test keyboard navigation throughout quiz flow

## Current Development Status

### Active Phase
**Phase 1: Component Extraction and Standardization**

### Current Task
**Task #1**: Create `src/components/exercises/QuizExercise.jsx` file

### Assigned
Development Team

### Estimated Completion
Phase 1: 3 days
Phase 2: 2 days
Phase 3: 5 days
**Total**: 10 days

### Development Notes
- Quiz logic already exists in LessonPreview.jsx and needs extraction
- Component pattern is well-established in existing exercise components
- Focus on reusing existing tested logic to minimize risk

### Next Up
1. Create QuizExercise component structure
2. Extract and adapt quiz logic from LessonPreview.jsx
3. Implement standard exercise interface

---

## Task Dependencies

### Critical Path
- Tasks 1-10 must be completed before Task 19
- Tasks 11-18 must be completed before Task 21
- Tasks 19-26 must be completed before Phase 3
- Tasks 27-31 depend on Tasks 19-26

### Parallel Development
- Tasks 1-10 and 11-18 can be developed in parallel
- Tasks 32-39 can be executed in parallel once integration is complete
- Phase 3 tasks can be prioritized based on user feedback

---

## Validation Criteria

### Phase 1 Completion
- [ ] QuizExercise component renders quiz data correctly
- [ ] FlashcardExercise component handles card navigation
- [ ] Both components follow standard exercise interface
- [ ] Components pass unit tests

### Phase 2 Completion
- [ ] Quiz functionality works in LessonDetail.jsx
- [ ] No placeholder text remains for quiz/flashcard exercises
- [ ] Progress tracking integration works
- [ ] All existing quiz data displays correctly

### Phase 3 Completion
- [ ] Enhanced UI provides better user experience
- [ ] Advanced features work as specified
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds current implementation
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met

---

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Tasks
- Task #20: Replacing placeholder text (ensure no regression)
- Task #24: Modal integration (styling conflicts possible)
- Task #30: Progress persistence (data integrity critical)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental testing after each task completion
- Backup existing functionality before modifications
- Code review for all integration tasks
- User acceptance testing before Phase 3

---

## Success Metrics

### Functional Success
