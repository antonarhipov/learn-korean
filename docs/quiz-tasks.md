## Task Dependencies

### Critical Path
- Tasks 1-10 must be completed before Task 19
- Tasks 11-18 must be completed before Task 21
- Tasks 19-26 must be completed before Phase 3
- Tasks 27-31 depend on Tasks 19-26

### Parallel Development
- Tasks 1-10 and 11-18 can be developed in parallel
- Tasks 32-39 can be executed in parallel once integration is complete
- Phase 3 tasks can be prioritized based on user feedback
