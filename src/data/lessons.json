        "historicalBackground": "Hangul was created by King Sejong the Great in 1443 during the Joseon Dynasty. Before Hangul, Koreans used Chinese characters (Hanja), which were difficult for common people to learn. King Sejong wanted to create a writing system that would be accessible to all social classes.",
        "culturalSignificance": "Hangul Day (한글날) is celebrated on October 9th in South Korea to honor the creation of the Korean alphabet. The creation of Hangul is considered one of the greatest achievements in Korean history and represents the democratic ideals of making literacy accessible to everyone.",
        "modernRelevance": "Today, Hangul is praised by linguists worldwide for its scientific design. UNESCO has established the King Sejong Literacy Prize in honor of the Korean alphabet's contribution to global literacy.",
        "etiquette": "When writing Korean, it's important to maintain proper stroke order and character proportions. In formal situations, using correct Hangul spelling and avoiding excessive use of English loanwords shows respect for Korean culture."

        "text": "Hangul is the Korean alphabet, created by King Sejong in 1443. It is considered one of the most scientific writing systems in the world.\n\nThe Korean alphabet consists of 14 basic consonants and 10 basic vowels. These letters are combined to form syllable blocks, which make up Korean words.\n\nIn this lesson, we'll introduce you to the basic structure of Hangul and show you how Korean characters are formed.",
